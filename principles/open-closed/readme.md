# Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

This principle is about class design and feature extensions.<br>

+ *Software entities â€¦ **should be open for extension, but closed for modification**.*
	+ **Open** for extension is: We should be able to change the behaviour. 
	+ **Closed** for modification. without changing the source code.

+ *An entity can **allow it's behaviour to be extented without modifying it's source code**.*

+ *Open chest surgery is not needed when putting on a coat.*

## Reason to use
+ Easier to maintain and prevent errors.

+ (Very useful for) legacy classes.
