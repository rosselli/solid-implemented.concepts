# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

This principle is about subtyping and inheritance.<br>

+ *Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.*

+ *Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.*

+ *If S is a subtype of T, then objects of T may be replaced with objects of S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.*

+ *If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but needs battery, you problaby have the wrong abstraction.*
