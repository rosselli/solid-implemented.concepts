# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

This principle is about business logic to clients communication.

+ *"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."*

+ *"If a class A depends on a B, ideally B should provide one interface for A, only with the things that A depends. A class
should not depend on methods it does not use."*

+ *"You want me to plug this in, where?"*
