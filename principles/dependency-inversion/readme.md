# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This principle wires up all other four principles in a single circle.

+ *Depend upon abstractions (interface). Do not depend upon concretions (class).*

+ *High-level modules should not depends on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.*

+ *Abstractions should not depends on details. Details should depend on abstractions.*

+ *Would you solder a lamp directly to the electrical wiring in a wall?*
